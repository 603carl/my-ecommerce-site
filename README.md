# My PHP Project

This repository contains the source code for my PHP-based website. The website is designed to be run locally on a XAMPP server. Follow the instructions below to get the project up and running on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html): A free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package that includes Apache, MySQL, and PHP.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. **Copy the Files**  
   After cloning the repository, copy the entire project folder into the `htdocs` directory of your XAMPP installation. The `htdocs` directory is typically located in the following path:
   - **Windows**: `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
   - **macOS**: `/Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/htdocs/`
   - **Linux**: `/opt/lampp/htdocs/`

3. **Start XAMPP**  
   Open XAMPP Control Panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.

4. **Database Setup (if applicable)**  
   If your project uses a MySQL database, follow these steps:
   - Open [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) in your web browser.
   - Create a new database.
   - Import the `.sql` file from the `database` directory of your project into the newly created database.
   - Update the database connection settings in your PHP files (`config.php` or wherever the database connection is defined).

5. **Access the Website**  
   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost/your-project-folder/` to view and interact with the website.
